This project is a comprehensive application developed based on the Qt framework, primarily targeting the fields of knowledge management and operating system simulation. It contains multiple functional modules, such as disk scheduling algorithm simulation, user registration and login, knowledge presentation, and Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling simulation.

## Main Functional Modules

- **Disk Scheduling Algorithm Simulation**: Implements the DiskScan algorithm to simulate the movement path of a disk read/write head.
- **User Registration and Login**: Provides functions for user registration, login, and password management.
- **Knowledge Presentation System**: Supports presentation, recommendation, and highlighting of knowledge nodes.
- **Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling Simulation**: Simulates the SJF process scheduling algorithm in operating systems.

## Technologies Used

- Developed using the C++ programming language.
- Based on the Qt framework to implement graphical user interface interaction.
- Uses an SQLite database for user information storage.
- Supports document path conversion and HTML text parsing.

## Installation Instructions

1. Ensure that the Qt development environment is installed.
2. Download the project source code and import it into Qt Creator.
3. Build the project and run it.

## Usage Instructions

- After launching the application, you can access each functional module through the main interface.
- Users must register and log in before they can access all features.
- Each module provides an independent window for operation. Please refer to the on-screen instructions for specific usage details.
